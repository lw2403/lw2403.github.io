                Iterative prototyping is an essential part of creating user interfaces. In this group project, my
                teammates and I designed an interface for a startup from scratch using only their concept. We did not
                use anything they‚Äôve already built such as logo, images, or content. Afterwards, we iterated on our
                design based on feedback from classmates and an industry critic, and tested our final prototype on real
                users through usertesting.com.

                        divided based on different categories. Events that are approaching will be prioritized and
                        appear
                        first. This is an important page to incentivize users to sign up given it‚Äôs a startup trying to

            <p class="wireframe-text">After sketching ideas on paper, we created wireframes by combining different ideas. 
                A design feature I want to highlight is the landing pages. Before users register, they can only see the home and explore events page. 
                To see the rest of the website, they need to signin. We believed this design would prompt more users to register for the site. 
                Since the company is in its startup stage, having more registered users would benefit scale and profitability.</p>

                        other categories when they click on tabs. We believe this design helps users

                <p>Solution:<em> Designed filters in the main page to help users identify events based on the type, the date, and time of day through 3 drop down menus .</em></p>

                    <p>We were cautious of potential accessibility issues during our design stage. Especially for the
                        graphs
                        on our analytics page, our team made sure that there are enough colour contrasts in the pie

                        and data charts.</p>

            <p>
                We expected the users to be able to complete the sub-tasks easily without any confusion given our
                intentional design of clear menu options, minimum number of buttons, and intuitive layout. The results
                from user testing aligned with our expectations and turned out to be very positive. One common thing they all
                mentioned was that the website is easy to navigate, simple, clear and well-put together. When watching
                their interactions with our site, we recognized that they all liked its modern and personal feel and
                appreciated its clear layout. The responses and comments from the three users are summarized below.

            </h5>
            <p>
                In general, the users not only found all four tasks easy to complete, but were also confident that they
                had completed the tasks successfully. The durations of time they spent on each task were very similar
                and no one seemed to struggle with a particular task. Though none of the users made an error, there were
                few moments when some users felt slightly unsure about their actions.

            <span>Takeaway and what I learned</span>
            <p>This project was an invaluable opportunity for me to work in a team and practice the entire iterative design process.
                By combining diverse ideas, feedback from classmates and industry experts, I learned various good practices
                of designing a clear, intuitive interface such as the importance of a coherent visual identity and clear
                navigation.</p>
