                Trella Tree Gift is a tree gifting app designed for an online tree buying, gifting, and planting
                experience. It targets people who are environmentally cautious and want to give unique presents to others.
                Through efforts to conduct user interviews, gain expertise advice, and
                collect data from iTrees, the app includes features such as naming the tree, building a personal forest,
                checking tree diaries, and gifting to friends.

                In the Fall of 2020, I joined Trella’s technology solutions team as a product manager and designer. 
                I was asked to design the user journey and experience of a tree gifting App. Trella is a New York based urban 
                forestry company that has over 100k+ trees internationally. As a result, in 3 months, I defined my target user’s needs and designed an app from the ground up. 
                <em style="color:rgba(53, 105, 88, 1)">This app’s goal is to inspire people to learn more about trees, shop trees, give trees as presents, share with others tree’s
                    benefits, and track individual contributions.</em>

                            special meanings such as friendship or anniversary. Each tree item provides information

                            trees have special meanings while others have bigger environmental benefits. The app is also

            <h6>Environmental Concerns</h6>
            <p class="wireframe-text">Climate change is a pressing and serious problem troubling everyone. Many people
                hope to contribute but don't understand how to help in a time efficient and fun way. Others struggle
                with finding ways to contribute and inspire more to join the efforts. Our team hope to make a sustainable, accessible, and fun way of planting trees.
                With further research, I realized it’s also important to educate users on the
                benefits of trees, and make the online gifting experience exciting so that people feel happy
                about giving or receiving a tree gift that they can name and grow on the platform.</p>

            <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
            <h5>Understanding the target users</h5>
            <h6>People who love nature & plants</h6>
            <p class="wireframe-text">Our team believes people who buy trees as gifts for themselves or others are the
                users of American Forest and Treedom. However both of the websites mentioned previously don't offer 
                user experience that helps the users influence their friends to also join the initiative.</p>
            <h6>People who like gifts</h6>
            <p class="wireframe-text">Trees have special meanings. Some trees live to hundreds of years and is often
                seen as a symbol for longevity. Each tree has a different representation and can have different meanings.
                People who receive virtual tree gifts will know that a real tree is planted on their behalf. 
                In addition, the online gift opening experience will help people connect with each other through trees.</p>

                to them as character tags.

                I am grateful for the opportunity to work at Trella because it’s a project that contributes 
                to a cause that I care a lot about. The 1st iteration of the project has wrapped up the design work and is 
                being handed off to the developers. The launch date is still to be determined. 
                However, some of the feedbacks collected in the user interviews are currently being considered as potential 
                new features to iterate once the 1st product is out. I was also able to apply many concepts taught in CS1300, 
                an UIUX class I took at Brown which especially helped me through the 3 months working at Trella.
